Compared to other coding languages, such as Java, Python has a less-limited programming approach. Another good thing about Python is that it has many frameworks that simplify the development process.

### HTML
Frontend structure using HTML is easily built and scalable. Every browser supports HTML Language. HTML is light weighted and fast to load. Storage of big files are allowed because of the application cache feature.
